# Text_Classification

I created a text classification model which is trained on 4 categories of newsgroups:
1. 'alt.atheism' 
2. 'soc.religion.christian' 
3. 'comp.graphics'
4. 'sci.med'
We used random forest algorithmn to classify the input text among these 4 categories.
Before, training the data, we preprocessed and explored the data with various visualization tools.
The best part is that, I used Streamlit to deploy the project and link for the model is:
